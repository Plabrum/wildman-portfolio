description: Run linting checks, build the project, commit changes, and push to main
---

Please deploy the changes by following these steps:

1. Run `npm run lint` to check for any linting errors. If there are errors, fix them before proceeding.
2. Run `npm run build` to build the project. If the build fails, fix the errors before proceeding.
3. If both linting and build pass successfully, commit all changes to git with an appropriate commit message.
4. Push the changes to the main branch.

Make sure all steps complete successfully before moving to the next step.
