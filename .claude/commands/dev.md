description: Start the development server and open it in a browser
---

Please start the development server by following these steps:

1. Run `npm run dev` in the background to start the Next.js development server.
2. Wait a moment for the server to start up (usually runs on http://localhost:3000).
3. Open the development server URL in the default browser.

Keep the server running so the user can see their changes live.
